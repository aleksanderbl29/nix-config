# To do list for a fresh install

This to do list is for my personal mac machine. A more elaborate to do list system will come at some point.

1. Run the steps in the readme.
2. Sign in to app store
    - Maybe run `nixswitch` once more.
3. Setup basic preferences
    - Import plist into raycast
    - Start alt-tab
      - Change keyboard shortcut to `cmd+tab`
4. Sign in to (and setup for machine-start) bitwarden
5. Cloud storage that needs signing in:
    - OneDrive
    - Dropbox
6. Import settings (plist) into stats.
7. Sign in to outlook app

Also do take a look at the other pages on the left hand side.
